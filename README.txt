This code is used by the Georgia Tech Secure Hardware and RoboSense research teams to drive a wheelchair.
Standard-length CAN messages are sent to the Arduino with simple driving instructions, and the Arduino activates
its output pins to drive a 5-way controller attached to a proprietary CAN bus on the wheelchair.
In this way, the motors can be controlled.

Examine pulse function to make sure all cases are handled
